"""
The idea of this script is to find the respective database instances using Boto3, and then find the 
respective databases in the instance and finally find the respective tables in each database and do a iterative
export and dump one table at a time to prevent overloading of memory.

This process can be expedited by parallel processing but I am unsure of how to do so yet. Would figure out a way
if this becomes a pertinent issue. 

Upload the file downloaded to s3 to the correct respective folders and buckets based on company
name. It is important to note that the files with the same name would be replaced. This would 
help in not saving redundant files but might not be useful if we want to version.

S3 files would be named as follows: 
s3://{BucketName-(Data Lake)}/{InstanceName}/{DBName}/{TableName}.csv
