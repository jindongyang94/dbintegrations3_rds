"""
The idea of this script is to find the respective database instances using Boto3, and then find the 
respective databases in the instance and finally find the respective tables in each database and do a iterative
export and dump one table at a time to prevent overloading of memory.

This process can be expedited by parallel processing but I am unsure of how to do so yet. Would figure out a way
if this becomes a pertinent issue. 

Upload the file downloaded to s3 to the correct respective folders and buckets based on company
name. It is important to note that the files with the same name would be replaced. This would 
help in not saving redundant files but might not be useful if we want to version.

Since tables will never be able to be appended directly from s3, it does not make sense to load the entire csv all the time. 
Perhaps write another script to merge each csvs based on time periodically. 

S3 files would be named as follows: 
s3://{BucketName}/{InstanceName}/{DBName}/{TableName}/{TableName-TimeStamp}.csv

# This method allows me to connect to export csv files for each table.
# This method does not require the maintenance of a JSON file at all, just different AWS credentials
# needed for different servers if different users have different access to the databases.

    Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.
    The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.
